generations:
  - name: "First Generation (AB10)"
    start_year: 2005
    end_year: 2014
    description: "The first-generation Toyota Aygo was developed as part of a joint venture between Toyota and PSA Peugeot Citroën (now Stellantis), resulting in three nearly identical city cars: the Toyota Aygo, Peugeot 107, and Citroën C1. Produced at a shared factory in the Czech Republic, the Aygo was designed specifically for European urban environments, featuring compact dimensions of just 3.4 meters in length, making it exceptionally maneuverable in tight city streets and easy to park in limited spaces. Available in three and five-door hatchback configurations, the Aygo featured distinctive styling with circular themes in its headlights and taillights, while maintaining an overall minimalist, functional design. Powered by a 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine producing 68 horsepower, paired with either a five-speed manual or optional automated manual transmission, the Aygo prioritized efficiency over performance with low emissions and fuel consumption as key selling points. The interior was simple and cheerful, with body-colored panels adding visual interest to an otherwise basic cabin, though space was predictably limited, particularly for rear passengers and cargo. Equipment levels were modest in base models, with features like air conditioning, power windows, and audio systems either optional or reserved for higher trim levels, reflecting the Aygo's positioning as an affordable entry-level vehicle. A facelift in 2009 brought minor styling refinements, improved interior materials, and enhanced equipment options. The first-generation Aygo successfully established Toyota in the European A-segment (city car) market, appealing to first-time buyers, urban dwellers, and those seeking maximum efficiency and low running costs in a reliable, affordable package."

  - name: "Second Generation (AB40)"
    start_year: 2014
    end_year: 2021
    description: "The second-generation Toyota Aygo continued the collaborative development with PSA Peugeot Citroën, again resulting in three related models, though with more distinctive styling for each brand compared to the first generation. The Aygo adopted a bold, expressive design centered around an X-shaped front fascia that became the model's signature element, available in contrasting colors to enhance its visual impact. This focus on personalization extended throughout the vehicle, with customizable exterior and interior elements allowing buyers to create a more individualized car—an important feature for appealing to younger consumers in the competitive city car segment. Still compact at approximately 3.45 meters in length, the new Aygo maintained its predecessor's urban-friendly dimensions while offering slightly improved interior space. Powered by an updated version of the 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine, now producing 69-72 horsepower depending on market and emissions regulations, the Aygo continued to emphasize efficiency with reduced CO2 emissions and improved fuel economy. Transmission options remained a five-speed manual or x-shift automated manual. The interior saw significant improvements in both design and material quality, featuring a more contemporary layout with a central 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system on higher trim levels, offering features like a backup camera, Bluetooth connectivity, and smartphone integration—advanced technology for the segment at the time. Safety features expanded to include standard stability control and multiple airbags, with pre-collision warning available on later models. A series of updates throughout this generation's life cycle brought revised styling (including variations on the X-face design), additional equipment options, and improved technology. The second-generation Aygo successfully built upon its predecessor's strengths while offering more expressive styling and better technology, maintaining its appeal in the urban-focused A-segment despite increasing competition from both traditional rivals and new entrants from budget brands."

  - name: "Third Generation (Aygo X)"
    start_year: 2022
    end_year: null
    description: "The third-generation Toyota Aygo, renamed Aygo X (pronounced 'Aygo Cross'), represents a significant reinvention of the model, developed solely by Toyota rather than as part of the previous joint venture with PSA/Stellantis. Built on Toyota's GA-B platform shared with the larger Yaris, the Aygo X adopts a crossover-inspired design with increased ride height, wheel arch cladding, and a more substantial overall presence while maintaining compact dimensions at approximately 3.7 meters in length—still among the smallest cars in the European market. The exterior design features a distinctive front end with LED lighting elements, a contrast-color roof option, and up to 18-inch wheels on higher trims—unusually large for the segment. Power comes exclusively from a 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine producing 72 horsepower, paired with either a five-speed manual or continuously variable transmission (CVT), prioritizing urban efficiency over performance. The interior offers a more premium environment than previous generations, with higher quality materials and increased space for both passengers and cargo. Technology takes a significant step forward with a standard 7-inch or optional 9-inch touchscreen infotainment system featuring wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, alongside available amenities including wireless phone charging, intelligent parking sensors, and a premium JBL audio system. Safety technology is comprehensive for the segment, with Toyota Safety Sense bringing advanced features like pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, and lane trace assist as standard equipment across the range. This generation reflects Toyota's strategy to maintain presence in the shrinking A-segment by creating a more distinctive, premium-feeling product that combines city car dimensions with crossover styling elements and technology from larger vehicles, offering a unique proposition as many competitors exit the smallest car categories in Europe due to tightening emissions regulations and changing consumer preferences."
